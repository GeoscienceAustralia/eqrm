the plot through the save feature if you require a PNG or PS (etc) file.

fdump
A python script to dump a binary file to the screen in hex and printable ASCII.
Try:

The left column is a hex offset of bytes from the start of the file.  The right-most
column is the offset in decimal.  The ASCII data shows an unprintable character as
a '.'.
