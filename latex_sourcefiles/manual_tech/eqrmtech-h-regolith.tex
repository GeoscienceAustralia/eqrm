\chapter{Regolith amplification}
\label{ch:reg}


\section{Overview}

Regolith is defined as the soil, geological sediments and
weathered rock that overly the un-weathered bedrock. It is well
documented that the presence of regolith can increase the level of
ground shaking experienced during an earthquake
(\citealt{dr_Borcherdt76a}; \citealt{dr_Murphy71a}).  For example,
studies in the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles Basin, U.S.A.,
have demonstrated that the damage patterns observed during the
1994 Northridge, California earthquake can be strongly correlated
to site-response of local regolith \citep{dr_Meremonte96a}.
Consequently, including the effect of regolith on earthquake
ground shaking is an important component of any seismic hazard or
risk analysis.

\subsection{Background theory}

An amplification factor can be used to transfer the earthquake
motion from the bedrock to the regolith surface. Amplification
factors are influenced by the regolith at the site of interest,
the magnitude $r_m$ of the event and the PGA for the event-site
combination. For simplicity, the geographical region of interest
is usually separated into five or six site-classes inside which
the regolith is assumed to be the same. The EQRM application does
not compute the amplification factors (or level of amplification).
Such calculations must be conducted off-line and the results (or
amplification factors) made available to the EQRM application. The
interested reader is referred to \citet{dr_Robinson06a} for a
detailed description of the equivalent linear technique for
computing amplification factors. \citet{dr_Dhu02b} discuss the
classification of site classes and the application of
amplification factors to a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis.
\fref{fig:regolith-newcexample-crosssection} illustrates the
geotechnical cross section for all of the site classes in the
Newcastle and Lake Macquarie region, and
\fref{fig:regolith-newcexample-ampfactors} shows an example of the
amplification factors use in the same study.

\section{The amplification factor input file}

The amplification factors are saved in a file with a name of the
form \typeparfile{<site\_loc>}{\_par}{\_ampfactors}{.mat} where
\typepar{site}{\_}{loc} is a variable in \typeself{set}{da}{ta}.
For example if \mbox{\typepar{site}{\_}{loc} = \typenewc} then the
file is called \typeparfile{newc}{\_par}{\_ampfactors}{.mat}. The
contents of the
\typeparfile{<site\_loc>}{\_par}{\_ampfactors}{.mat} include 5
`variable types' that are explained in \tref{tab:reg-datafile}.
\aref{app:regolith-datafile-complete} lists the contents for
\typeparfile{newc}{\_par}{\_ampfactors}{.mat} as used in the
Newcastle and Lake Macquarie study \citep{dr_Dhu02b}.

\begin{table}
\caption{Summary of the variables in
\typeparfilecaption{<site\_loc>}{\_par}{\_ampfactors}{.mat}. The
\{1\}, \{2\} and \{3\} represent input text strings that are
pointers to the site class, moment magnitude bin and bedrock PGA
bin respectively, for both the amplification factors and their
standard deviation. The
\typeparfilecaption{<site\_loc>}{\_par}{\_ampfactors}{.mat} file
usually contains multiple `copies' of
\typevarcaption{}{}{ln\_site\{1\}\_rockpga\{2\}\_momag\{3\}} and
\typevarcaption{}{}{stdln\_site\{1\}\_rockpga\{2\}\_momag\{3\}},
whereas it should only contain a single `copy' of the other
variables. All variables are row vectors. The superscript `$\ast$'
shown with some variables refers to the fact that these variables
have been `binned'.} \vspace{0.8em} \label{tab:reg-datafile}

\section{Implementation}

As with the attenuation, the implementation of the amplification
factors is conducted within \typefunc{do}{\_ana}{lysis} (for both
hazard and risk assessments) in a two step process as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The preparation of the amplification factors
(\typefunc{prep}{\_}{amps}) conducted before entering a loop over
sites. \item Application of the amplification factors to compute
$A_{S_a,soil}(T_o,r_m,R)$ at each site
(\typefunc{do}{\_amp}{lification}) conducted within a loop over
sites.
\end{enumerate}

The preparation of amplification factors involves interpolating
each to the periods defined in the \typeself{set}{da}{ta}
parameter \typepar{per}{io}{ds} (see \sref{attn:implementation})
and is conducted by the function \typefunc{prep}{\_}{amps}. The
application of the amplification factors is carried out
immediately after the evaluation of the attenuation model and is
implemented within \typefunc{do}{\_amp}{lification}. The process
is described for a specific site located within a known Site
Class:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Bin all of the events in the event catalogue into the
bedrock PGA and moment magnitude bins defined by the bin centroids
in \typevar{}{}{pga\_bin} and \typevar{}{}{momag\_bin}
respectively. Note that the end points of the 'central' bins are
assumed to be half way between the bin centroids. The first and
last bins extend to negative and positive infinity respectively.
\item Use a nested loop over all PGA bins (upper loop) and moment
magnitude bins (lower loop) and apply the amplification factor as
follows:
\begin{equation}
S_{a,soil}(T_o,r_m,R)= F_{amp}(T_o,r_m^*,PGA^*) \times
S_{a,bedrock}(T_o,r_m,R),
\end{equation}
where $r_m^*$ and $PGA^*$ are the centroids of the bins containing
$r_m$ and \newline $S_{a,bedrock}(0,r_m,R)$ respectively. The
$F_{amp}$ represents the exponential of `some selection' of
amplification factor from the distribution \newline \mbox{$N \sim
(\mu_{log(F)}(T_o,r_m^*,PGA^*),\sigma_{log(F)}(T_o,r_m^*,PGA^*))$}.
The actual selection  made will depend on the method used to
incorporate uncertainty (see \sref{sec:regolith-incorp-unc}).
\end{enumerate}
Notice that the use of $N \sim (\mu_{log(F)},\sigma_{log(F)})$
equates to the assumption that the amplification factors are
log-normally distributed.

\section{Incorporating aleatory uncertainty}
\label{sec:regolith-incorp-unc}


In theory, both the random selection and PDF sampling methods
described in \sref{attn:uncertainty} could be used to incorporate
aleatory uncertainty in amplification factors. Some care will need
to be taken if the PDF sampling technique is to be used for
incorporating uncertainty at several levels  of computation (e.g.
for attenuation and amplification) due to the need to spawn the
event catalogue (see \sref{source:spawning}) at every level. Such
iterative spawning may lead to a `blow-out' in the size of the
event catalogue and hence the computation time. sCurrently only
the random selection technique is available for use with the
amplification factors in the EQRM application.

As with the application of an attenuation model, the EQRM applies
\typefunc{pga}{\_cut}{off} to $S_{a,soil}(T_o,r_m,R)$ after
applying the amplification factor. This accounts for any
unrealistically high selection of amplification factor. A
secondary upper cut-off facility exists and involves the use of
the \typeself{set}{da}{ta} parameter \typepar{Max}{Amp}{Factor}.
The \typepar{Max}{Amp}{Factor} parameter is applied directly to
the amplification factor as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:regolith-maxampfactor}
F_{new}(T_o,r_m^*,PGA^*) = \left \{ \begin{array}{ll} F_{old} & \textrm{$\forall$ \hspace{0.2em} $T_o$ s.t. $F_{amp,old}<$\typepar{Max}{Amp}{Factor}} \\
\textrm{\typepar{Max}{Amp}{Factor}} & \textrm{$\forall$ \hspace{0.2em} $T_o$ s.t. $F_{amp,old} \geq $ \typepar{Max}{Amp}{Factor}} \\
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
or brevity the functional reference to $r_m^*$ and $PGA^*$ in
$F_{new}$ and $F_{old}$ in
\ereftwo{eq:regolith-maxampfactor}{eq:regolith-minampfactor}
refers to the fact that these values represent the bin centroids
of \typevar{mo}{mag}{\_bin} and \typevar{p}{ga}{\_bin}
respectively. In most simulations the secondary cutoff is not used
since \typefunc{pga}{\_cut}{off} handles scaling for an upper
bound. Ignoring \typepar{Max}{Amp}{Factor} is achieved by setting
it to to a very high number (e.g.
\typepar{Max}{Amp}{Factor}=10000). In contrast, there is another
parameter in \typeself{set}{da}{ta} known as
\typepar{Min}{Amp}{Factor} which is commonly utilised within the
EQRM application. This parameter stops the selection of any
unrealistically low selections of the amplification factor. The
\typepar{Min}{Amp}{Factor} is commonly set to around 0.6. It is
applied as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:regolith-minampfactor}
F_{new}(T_o,r_m^*,PGA^*) = \left \{ \begin{array}{ll} F_{old} & \textrm{$\forall$ \hspace{0.2em} $T_o$ s.t. $F_{amp,old} >$\typepar{Min}{Amp}{Factor}} \\
\textrm{\typepar{Min}{Amp}{Factor}} & \textrm{$\forall$ \hspace{0.2em} $T_o$ s.t. $F_{amp,old} \leq $ \typepar{Min}{Amp}{Factor}} \\
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
Note that a value of \mbox{$F<1$} leads to a de-amplification of
the bedrock motion.
