This directory provides documentation to support your use of the
EQRM. It includes a copy of the technical manual (version 3.0). Please
note that this technical manual is for an older version of the EQRM
that was coded in MATLAB. It has been included due to the useful
description of methodology.

Whilst the majority of the methodology remains unchanged - care should
be taken when interpreting any comments in the technical manual
(Version 3.0) that refer to code because the majority of these are now
outdated. We apologise for any inconvenience caused by this and
endeavour to release an updated manual in the future. In the meantime,
sufficient information has been provided with this pacakage to
overcome any difficulties related to the outdated manaual.

Of particular note 
  ** there have been a number of changes to inputs:
	- some input filenames have changed
	- some input file formats are different
	- some inputs in the setdata parameter file are different
	 (see new_param_list.pdf 
	  for further information)
  ** the directory structure is different
  ** there is a known error in the section entitled 'Hysteretic
  Damping' beginning on page 85.
