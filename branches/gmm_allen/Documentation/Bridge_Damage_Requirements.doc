This documents the requirements for calculating bridge damage from
earthquakes.

The initial document that covers the technical method of arriving
at damage estimates is "Bridge Seismic Fragility Modelling in EQRM.doc".

Initial requirements:
1. Write a python function:
     (none, slight, moderate,
      extensive, complete) = bridge_damage(CLASS, sa_0_3, sa_1_0, skew, spans)
   where the parameters to the function are:
     CLASS   bridge class (a string like 'HWB1')
     sa_0_3  spectral acceleration for T=0.3s
     sa_1_0  spectral acceleration for T=1.0s
     skew    the bridge skew, in degrees
     spans   the number of bridge spans

   The spectral acceleration figures are AFTER any adjustments for soil and
   distance effects.
2. Write a function to take raw earthquake data and produce spectral
   acceleration figures AT THE BRIDGE.
3. Modify the existing EQRM code for buildings to handle bridges.
