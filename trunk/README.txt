Welcome to the EQRM!! 

Please note that this is an beta-release. We have undertaken a range of tests
on the performance of this code and are comfortable releasing it for open source
use. You are welcome to use the code, however we do not gaurantee that it is bug
free (see copyright.pdf for more information and license agreements).


Questions and comments are welcomed. Please join the list
    eqrm-user (https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=198293).

In your e-mail please mention the release number.

A number of README files are provided to help you use the EQRM:
	1) README-install.txt
	Install instructions

	2) README-getting-started.txt
	
	Instructions to help you get started. 
	Includes a description of:
	 * inputs
	 * demos and how to run them
	 * post processing instructions

	3) ./documentation
	Directory containing:
	 * a technical manual (see ++).
	 * the latest description of parameters

++ We recommend that new users begin with
README-getting-started.txt. The technical manual is for an older
version of the EQRM that was coded in MATLAB. It has been included due
to the useful description of methodology, the majority of which
remains unchanged. All references to software in the technical manual
are out of date.
